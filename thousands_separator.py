# Write a function named format_number that takes a non-negative number as its only parameter.

# Your function should convert the number to a string and add commas as a thousands separator.
# For example, calling format_number(1000000) should return "1,000,000".

#Challenge taken from: https://pythonprinciples.com/challenges/Thousands-separator/ 19/04/21

def format_number(number):
    pass

print(format_number(1000000))
